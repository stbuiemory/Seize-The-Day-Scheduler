## üíª Installation

```sh
üîπ We were not given a starter code and were asked to create our own day scheduler based on the sample application provided in Module 5 challenge.
üîπ The application needs to allow users to enter text and save in each time slot. 
üîπ The page can be refreshed but the info entered will remain because they are recorded in local storage.
üîπ The user events will be color-coded based on its type (past=gray, present=green, future=pink).
```
